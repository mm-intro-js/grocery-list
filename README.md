# Grocery List
Completing this assignment depends on knowing:

- Basic JavaScript: variables, functions, conditionals
- JavaScript DOM methods for locating, adding and removing elements

### Requirements
Behavior:

- Add Item button should:
  - hide the button
  - show the form
- Form submit should:
  - add a new item to the list
  - then hide the form
  - show the New Item button


## Write good JavaScript code!

- Use functions to break down the functionality into small tasks
- Practice good coding standards with clear variable and function names, use ES6 `let` and `const` instead of `var`
- Make sure your variables are well named.  Avoid abbreviations and use camelCase to make multi-word names readable.
